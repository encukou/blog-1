# DRM as the reason for Silence

I like the idea of Scream and technological decay, and find it easy to believe. However, I decided to add one more reason for the Silence and losing pre-tech: DRM.

## What is DRM

At the moment of the space expansion, megacorporations wanted to ensure a constant income from the software and hardware they produce. So, every piece of tech had some kind of [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management). It is a protection measure enforcing users to pay for service and constantly upgrade their tools, ships, all technologies. Not every technology was protected but most of it, enough to cause chaos when the connection with the licensing center was lost.

## Types of DRM

+ **Self-destruction by timer** ensures that the technology becomes useless after a set period of time. For example, if the release cycle of [eyephone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uASUHbFEhWY) is 10 years, model v23 turns into a brick after 10 years after release to motivate buying v24.
+ **Repair protection** ensures that the software can be opened only by a licensed repair center using special licensed tools with the limit on how many techs can be fixed before the license renewal. For example, the ship's board computer MkBook Space Pro can be fixed only in a special Re:Stock center. If it is opened without a special licensed tool, the processor melts on losing contact with the housing.

## What happened

When the license is expired or the piece of tech got broken for natural reasons, people acted in  different ways:

+ Most people just threw away now useless pieces of scrap.
+ Some people hoard it in their backyard for the same reason as you keep these beautiful notebooks you're never going to use.
+ Not all pieces of pretech were protected, and some were protected partially. For example, there are still pre-tech ships with replaced board computer and maybe spike drive. All plugs are also proprietary which complicates a bit the replacement procedure but they can be replaced as well.
+ Some genius engineers managed to bypass the protection and make a piece of pretech work without a license. Few of them, but they are the reason why we managed to stay on the TL4 level without getting all the way back to TL3.

## Fate of corporations

+ Most repair centers and factories were plundered for licenses
+ Most corporations kept their factories on third-world planets and headquarters on [central planets](https://firefly.fandom.com/wiki/Central_planets). So, headquarters couldn't provide license renewals for the local planet and were plundered as well.
+ Some corporations lost blueprints but managed to keep the secret of license production. These corporations have the power of resurrecting the old world technologies, and so they have power. It can be a good explanation to introduce [corporatocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatocracy) like [The Board](https://theouterworlds.fandom.com/wiki/Halcyon_Holdings_Corporate_Board) from The Outer Worlds.

## Story hooks

DRM-protected pretech provides good opportunities for story hooks and just interesting situations:

+ PCs found a nice riffle but it is DRM protected, and so they need someone to unlock it.
+ Heroes have two pieces of pretech and one repair tool with one license unlock remaining. So, now they should make a choice about what they want to keep and what they want to sell.
+ A merchant restored information about a pretech world smuggler who managed to hide 10 licenses and then vanished in the chaos of Silence. PCs are asked to find the hideout, retrieve the licenses, and bring them back.

## What is the license

+ The license can be either data (let's hack!) or a physical tool.
+ It is valuable and worth going into an adventure.
+ It is useful only if you have a locked old-world technology.
