# Melee weapon in SWN

Why one would focus on melee combat in the world with laser weapons? Well, there are few situational advantages of melee weapon over ranged weapon:

1. Execution Attack makes any melee weapon 100% deadly if the actor can stay unnoticed long enough. That means effective assassinations and stealth.
1. The melee weapon doesn't make noise. Again, better stealth.
1. The melee weapon doesn't need ammo. Depending on the planet's economical situation and your campaign, it can be critical. This is why the melee weapon exists in Fallout, not everyone can afford a rifle and ammo for it just to fight radroaches. A better example is the classic Mad Max movie where he has a shotgun but, if I remember correctly, no ammo for it.
1. Melee is more effective in the close range. In practice, the situation is often escalates to confrantation after close range negotiation. Also, spaceships are dense because of need to save space for fuel and reduce air needed.
1. Melee weapon is available. You can use improvised weapon escaping from a prison, being stuck on an alien planet without energy left, or having pass security taking out all your weapon.

Again, in Fallout there is a lot of melee weapons, including power weapons, but a big clumsy melee weapon, especially requiring power to work, is unlikely to have much sense for most campaigns. Most likely, adventurers will prefer more small and handy weapons sacrificing the damage level in favor of smaller encumbrance (and less attention from authorities). Remember, they expected to walk around with it.
