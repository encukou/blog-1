# Bend: Intro

## The City

Welcome to Bend! This is the year 1984, and you are kids living in the southern district of a small city in Central Oregon, United States. The population is about 18k people, 3k of them are kids. This is your world, this city, this forest, these people. Adults do their adult things: talk about baseball, build houses, work on the secret research facility, search the forest for the kid that disappeared recently. Meanwhile, you explore the world around you, go on adventures, fight with kids from other schools, face mysterious things you can't handle or even understand... Welcome to Bend!

## The Game

Start from watching this video: [Dungeons and Dragons, explained](https://youtu.be/2PEt5RdNHNw). It will give you a base understanding of what is role-playing and why people do it. And below are a few topics I find the most important to understand to get started:

+ **There is no losing or winning**. The worst thing that can happen is your character dies and you get a new one. So, afraid of nothing, you can make mistakes and it won't ruin the fun. Even more, sometimes you even should make mistakes if you think your character will do it. In every challenge you face in the game, the goal is not to beat the game but to role-play it so it is believable, memorable, and dramatic. Think about it not as a chess championship but as a movie. You're a writer of this story, and it should be interesting, not perfect.
+ **The goal is to have fun**. We cooperatively write this imperfect but engaging story, together overcome challenges and solve puzzles, enjoy role-playing, interact with this world, and after the game, we have amazing shared memories and stories.
+ **It's cooperative**. We play together, and so we all should ensure that everyone at the (virtual) table is having fun. Don't steal the thunder or limelight from each other, don't interrupt, don't make decisions for other players, don't judge them. And then we will have amazing memories and want to play together again.
+ **It's not DnD, actually**. I linked a video about DnD because DnD is the most popular RPG, and for some people these things are equal. So, Googling about DnD will give you a basic understanding of what it is all about but our game is a bit different. Our game is narration-oriented rather than combat-oriented, much simpler (you don't need to learn any rules in advance, I'll walk you through the process), and about regular kids rather than fantasy heroes.
+ **It's not a video game**. We play the game because it allows us to make any decisions we want. There is no dialog tree, no pre-determined story, no saves and re-plays, no walkthrough. And this is amazing. Play natural, don't expect a challenge to have "the right" solution.
+ **[Suspension of disbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief) is important**. To have fun playing the game, you should believe in this imaginary world. You know that movies aren't real, that all these people are actors, and all action is fictional, all drama is made up, all things are impossible. However, you let yourself believe in it, and only then you'll enjoy it. The same is with the game. Let yourself and others believe in it, dive into the fictional world, take a role, and we all will have fun.

If you want to be better prepared, search for something like "how to be a good DnD player". Social communications with other players are the hardest and the most rewarding part of the game.

## The character

First of all, you will generate your character. This is the kid you will play for. We will discuss the mechanic of making a character later, for now, a few important things to give you a general understanding what is your character:

+ **It's not you**. The point of role-playing is to play the role of someone else. It doesn't mean you run from yourself but rather do good acting to make an interesting story.
+ **Flaws are fun**. Imagine a book where everything is perfectly fine and the main character always succeeds at everything. It's boring, there is no drama. Best stories happen when heroes make mistakes, the best characters are with flaws that fuel the narration. Indiana Jones is afraid of snakes, Boromir gets corrupted by the ring, Mr. Darcy is prideful, Marty McFly takes any challenge when someone says he's "chicken". These are flaws that make the story.
+ **Specialization makes a better team**. One kid is good at thinking, another kid knows the street, another kid is strong and brave, another kid knows how to fix things. And together they make a great team. The team that can handle any challenge and in the long run none feel useless. Make your character with an explicit specialization, and it will be memorable, have moments to shine, and allow others to shine as well.

## The adventure

When we finish building all characters and the world, you'll be able to go on an adventure. This is how the process looks like:

1. You decide where you want to go and what to do. In the very beginning, I'll present a list of rumors that you've heard from other kids. Some of them are true, some of them are overdramatized, some of them aren't real at all. But don't be afraid to pick a "wrong one", any of them will lead to an interesting discovery. Later, after a few adventures, you'll know the city and collect your own goals and rumors.
1. You decide who wants to go on this adventure and make a team. The best scenario is when every time the team is different and there is no distinct team where all players are always the same. It's fun to play with different players and different characters, so you can look at similar challenges from a different perspective. The best group size is 3-4 players but I don't limit you here in any way.
1. You pick the date and time that suits you best. My availability is quite flexible.
1. On the date, we meet at the virtual table and play. I describe the world around you, you describe how your character reacts. We're having fun!
1. After the session, one of the players from the team writes a summary of the adventure. Think about it like you tell other kids about what you discovered. It's ok if not everything is precise or even true. Role-play it, make more rumors, enlighten other players to go on their adventure.
1. Repeat.

You can read a bit more on specifics here: [What defines a "West Marches" campaign](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/120770/what-defines-a-west-marches-campaign).

## The theme

You can raise any topic in the game, just make sure that everyone else is fine with it. Don't hurt other people, it's easier than you might think.

Sensitive themes I may raise in the game:

+ Death and injury
+ Hallucinations
+ Mental disorders
+ Dangerous strangers
+ Claustrophobia

Themes that I won't raise (and you, probably, shouldn't too):

+ Sex, puberty, and anything like [Big Mouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mouth_(TV_series)).
+ Alcoholism and drug addiction.
+ Domestic violence.

## The DM

[I am the DM, and the DM means me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h61UvcKeTdY). DM means "Dungeon Master". Some use "Game Master" or "Referee" instead but DM sounds cooler. Being the DM is a huge responsibility. That means to be responsible for the whole world, all NPCs, resolving challenges, making the world alive, planning the adventure, controlling the pacing to make the game fun for everyone. So, this is what you can do to help me with it:

+ Have fun and make sure all other players are having fun.
+ If someone else behaves in a way that spoils the fun for everyone else, don't wait for the DM to address it, take the initiative.
+ Play the role, interact with the world and each other. This is how you help with world-building.
+ Don't ask the DM to help with overcoming a challenge. They are designed for you, and there is no correct answer. The role of the DM is not to provide solutions but rather resolve the solution you come up with.
