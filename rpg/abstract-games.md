# No-component abstract board games

You're in the middle of nowhere with someone. You need a way to spend time and you're thinking about playing a board game. However, all you have is:

1. Some stones, sticks, or cents to denote player tokens.
1. Some dirt or paper to draw a small board.

What can you play? All you remember is tic-tac-toe and it lost its appeal since you found a strategy. If only you knew other games... I have great news for you. There are actually a lot of games that fit this setup! And if you find yourself in such situation too often, you can make some props (the grid and the tokens) and have it with you in the travel backpack, just in case.

Below I've listed all such games I know with links to the boargamegeek. For all games that have short and simple rules, I also copy-pasted these rules there. So, you can just print this article in case you won't have internet too.

Common elements for all games:

+ For 2 players of any reasonable age.
+ Square grid with the size somewhere between 4x4 and 6x6 squares.
+ Maximum 12 tokens needed for each player.

## Bolotudu (Africa, 1900)

+ 12 tokens for each player
+ 5x6 grid

During initial set-up players take turns to place their pieces on empty squares of the board, two pieces at a time. They must avoid 'three in a row' orthogonally during this phase.

In the second phase players move their pieces to adjacent squares trying to form 'three in a row' (diagonals don't count). After making 'three in a row' a player removes an enemy piece which is adjacent to either side of this row. A player loses the game when only 2 pieces of his colour remain on the board.

## Dara (Nigeria, 1800)

+ 12 tokens for each player
+ 5x6 grid

The game begins with the players taking alternating turns placing one of their pieces in an empty space. Once all of the pieces have been placed, the players alternate moving one of their pieces into an adjacent empty space. Diagonal movement is not allowed.

When a player moves a piece to cause three of their pieces to be in a row, that player may remove one opposing piece that is not part of a row of three such pieces. Players are not permitted to make a move which results in more than three of their pieces being in a row. A player wins the game when the opposing player is unable to make a a row of three pieces.

## Ithaka (2002)

+ 4 colours, 3 tokens in each color (12 in total)
+ 4x4 grid

The pieces are initially arranged so that the three pieces of each color occupy a corner space and the two adjacent edge spaces.

All of the pieces are shared by both players. Each player, in turn, moves one piece any number of spaces in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line over as many empty spaces as is desired, with the following restrictions:

1. The piece moved must not be the same piece moved on your opponent's most recent turn.
1. The piece moved must begin next to a piece of the same color.

Win either by getting three pieces of one color in a row or by leaving your opponent with no available moves.

## Jul-Gonu (Korea)

+ 4 tokens for each player
+ 4x4 grid

Each player starts with their tokens on the first row. A stone moves to an orthogonal adjacent empty cell.

Capture is custodian -- if a stone after moving has some enemy stones between itself and another friendly stone then those stones are captured.

A player loses if he has just one stone or is unable to move.

## Five Field Kono (Korea)

+ 7 tokens for each player
+ 5x5 grid

Each piece can move one square diagonally. There is no capture or jumping. The object of the game is to move all seven pieces to the opposite end of the board, where the opponent's pieces started. The first player to do this wins the game.

## Four Field Kono (Korea, 2005)

+ 8 tokens for each player
+ 4x4 grid

Each player starts with their tokens on the first two rows.

The are two ways of moving:

1. Move one square, vertical or horizontal, into an empty square.
1. Jump over one of your own pawns and land directly on top of an opponent's pawn, vertical or horizontal, and thereby taking the opponent's pawn out of the game.

The goal is to take away all of the opponent's pawns, or to force him into a situation where he cannot move.

## Neutreeko (2001)

+ 8 tokens for each player
+ 5x5 grid

Pieces move by sliding orthogonally or diagonally until blocked by the edge of the board or another piece.

The object of the game is to arrange your pieces in a line of three either orthogonally or diagonally.

## Neutron (1978)

+ 5 tokens for each player and 1 token to denote neutorn
+ 5x5 grid

In Neutron, players have two sets of subatomic particles and have to force a neutron to bounce towards their side.

Each player starts with their tokens on the first row. All pieces move in a straight line in one of the 8 directions, and they cannot stop until they find an obstacle. There is no capturing.

The Neutron is a common piece, initially put on the center of the board.

The first player only moves one of their pieces. Afterward, on their turn, each player must first move the Neutron and then one of his own pieces. Moving and forcing the Neutron into your home row, or blocking it completely so that it cannot move, is the object of the game.

## Seega (North Africa)

+ 12 tokens for each player
+ 5x5 grid

Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. "sandwiching"). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears. To win, reduce your opponent to one piece (or none). Draws often occur.

## Squava (2011)

+ 12 tokens for each player
+ 5x5 grid

Players alternate turns placing a pawn of their colour on an empty space of the board.

Players strive to make a line of 4 pieces of their colour, but lose if they make a line of 3 before doing so. Lines can be orthogonal or diagonal.

## Quixo (1995)

+ 12 tokens for each player
+ 5x5 grid

Below are the rules as they described on the BGG page. They assume that you have 25 cubes with "X", "O", or " " (blank) on their sides. So, if you play the game with regular tokens as all other games in the list, just assume that an empty space on the grid is an empty cube and when you need to "rotate" a cube, place your token on the space instead.

On a turn, the active player takes a cube that is blank or bearing his symbol from the outer ring of the grid, rotates it so that it shows his symbol (if needed), then adds it to the grid by pushing it into one of the rows from which it was removed. Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles. Play continues until someone forms an orthogonal or diagonal line of five cubes bearing his symbol, with this person winning the game.

## Mixtour (2011)

+ 10 tokens for each player
+ 5x5 grid

Starting with an empty board, players enter new pieces and move them trying to build up stacks with 5 or more pieces to win the game. There are many move options: stacks can be split at any level, opponent pieces may be moved, yet a move must always end on another stack. In fact, it is the height of the receiver stack that determines the range of possible moves.

## King's Valley (2006)

+ 5 tokens for each player (1 of them should be different and represent a king)
+ 5x5 grid

Any piece can move straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal, but always as far as possible. Pieces always stop their movement either at the sides of the board or before another tile in the same row, column, or diagonal.
The winner is the first player that manages to move his king piece to the central square of the board, which represents the King's Valley.

## All Queens Chess (2008)

+ 6 tokens for each player
+ 5x5 grid

The initial placement is a bit tricky, see the website: <https://www.vat19.com/item/all-queens-chess-game>.

To win the game and claim the throne, you must get four of your six queens in a straight line in any direction. As in chess, queens can move any number of spaces in a straight line but unlike chess, must stop if an opponent is blocking the way.

## Bobail (Africa)

+ 5 tokens for each player and one to represent Bobail
+ 5x5 grid

The winner is the player who captures the Bobail (placed in the middle of the grid). To do so, the Bobail needs to be moved on the player's baseline.

On each turn, a player must do the following two actions in this specific order :

1. Move the Bobail. It moves one square in any direction. If the Bobail cannot be moved, the game is lost by the player.
1. Move one of the player's token. A token move in any direction to the furthest square, but cannot leap over other tokens.

One last thing, for its first turn, the first player don't play the Bobail. He plays directly one of his token.

## British Square (1978)

+ 12 tokens for each player
+ 5x5 grid

The object of British Square is to place the greatest number of your pieces on the board. On your turn you may place your piece anywhere on the board except orthogonally next to any of your opponents pieces. Diagonally adjacent is acceptable. Play continues until both players are unable to place pieces. Winner is the player with the most pieces on the board.
