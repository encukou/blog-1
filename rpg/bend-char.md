# Bend: Making a character

## The process

There are two kinds of stats you're going to pick: mechanical and role playing. Mechanical affect numbers and possibilities, role playing affect how the character behaves.

Mechanical:

1. Attributes
1. Strength
1. Iconic item

Role playing:

1. Drive
1. Pride
1. Problem
1. Flaws

## Skill checks

Every adventure has a lot of challenges. When you're running from a monster, trying to understand alien language, reading footprints, convincing the police that you've seen the kid missed 40 years ago, how do you tell what's going to happen next? Whenever it's uncertain whether or not your hero can overcome a challenge, it's time to roll a skill check.

Skill check means that you roll two six-sided dice and add the number corresponding to the most appropriate attribute. For example, to lift a heavy rock you add your strength modifier. If the value is equal or bigger than the challenge set by the DM, you succeed. Failure at the roll means that your hero either botched it outright, succeeded in a way that was singularly unhelpful, or was foiled by some unexpected outside influence.

For example, you're trying to squeeze into a tight hole leading into an undersground cave system. So, you roll 2 six-sided dice and add your dexterity modifier which is for your character is 3. You rolled 8 and with the modifier it is 11. The DM checks his notes and the challenge rating for this is 9. Since 11 is bigger than 9, you succeed. On failure, the character could stuck in the hole.

Before making a skill check, you can anounce that you want to spend some of your luck points to add them to the roll. So, the final formula is:

```
2d6 + attribute + (optional) luck points >= challenge rating
```

The DM can reward luck points for good role playing. Also, some strengths can give luck points for some actions. Every adventure starts with 1 luck point plus luck points rewarded between sessions, all unused ones from the previous adventure are lost.

When you're under pressure and something must be done immediately (in a heat of battle), instead of 2d6 you roll one tweelve-sided die. Why all that complication? Because it gives different probabilities. See these links: [2d6](https://anydice.com/program/20) and [1d12](https://anydice.com/program/1a58).
