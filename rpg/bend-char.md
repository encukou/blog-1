# Bend: Making a character

## The process

The goal of this virtual session is to generate 2 characters for each player:

+ Player Character (PC). This is who you will play.
+ Non-Player Character (NPC). This is just another kid in the city. Maybe, it's your friend, brother, or sister. If something bad happens with your character, you switch to playing this one.

Stats:

1. Attributes
1. Feat
1. Iconic item
1. Pride
1. Skill
1. Problem
1. Flaw
1. Fear

And don't forget to pick your character name and pronouns. Pronouns can be any, we value your fun over historical accuracy. Also, it's good if you provide a short description what other think about them.

## Skill checks

Every adventure has a lot of challenges. When you're running from a monster, trying to understand alien language, reading footprints, convincing the police that you've seen the kid missed 40 years ago, how do you tell what's going to happen next? Whenever it's uncertain whether or not your hero can overcome a challenge, it's time to roll a skill check.

Skill check means that you roll two six-sided dice and add the number corresponding to the most appropriate attribute. For example, to lift a heavy rock you add your strength modifier. If the value is equal or bigger than the challenge set by the DM, you succeed. Failure at the roll means that your hero either botched it outright, succeeded in a way that was singularly unhelpful, or was foiled by some unexpected outside influence.

For example, you're trying to squeeze into a tight hole leading into an undersground cave system. So, you roll 2 six-sided dice and add your dexterity modifier which is for your character is 3. You rolled 8 and with the modifier it is 11. The DM checks his notes and the challenge rating for this is 9. Since 11 is bigger than 9, you succeed. On failure, the character could stuck in the hole.

Before making a skill check, you can anounce that you want to spend some of your luck points to add them to the roll. So, the final formula is:

> 2d6 + attribute + (optional) luck points >= challenge rating

The DM can reward luck points for good role playing. Also, some feats can give luck points for some actions. Every adventure starts with 1 luck point plus luck points rewarded between sessions, all unused ones from the previous adventure are lost.

When you're under pressure and something must be done immediately (in a heat of battle), instead of 2d6 you roll one tweelve-sided die. Why all that complication? Because it gives different probabilities. See these links: [2d6](https://anydice.com/program/20) and [1d12](https://anydice.com/program/1a58).

## Attributes

There are 6 attributes:

+ **Strength**: physical prowess, melee combat, carrying gear, brute force
+ Constitution**: hardiness, enduring injury, resisting toxins, going without food or sleep, long run duration.
+ **Dexterity**: agility, balance, coordination, reflexes, evasion, reaction time, short run speed.
+ **Intelligence**: memory, reasoning, technical skills, general education.
+ **Wisdom**: noticing things, making judgments, reading situations, intuition.
+ **Charisma**: commanding, charming, attracting attention, being taken seriously.

Distribute among them the following numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3. Bigger is better.

## Feat

+ **Animal friend**. You have unusual empathy and understanding with animals. Spend 1 luck point to ask an animal a question or ask it to do something.
+ **Bully**. Add +3 to rolls for persuading someone with violence.
+ **Charlatan**. You can do "magic" tricks.
+ **Cool Under Pressure**. Spend 1 luck point to roll 2d6 instead of 1d12.

+ **Unassuming**. Spend 1 luck point to not be seen for 6 seconds, within reason.
+ **Warrior**. You know how to make and use weapons. Making weapon includes slingshots and crossbows, using also includes shotguns, rifles, pistols. Usually kids don't have real weapons, though.
+ **Wealthy**. Spend luck points to buy useful items between adventures.

If you don't see anything that fits you, let me know what you want and we will think how to describe it through the game mechanic.

## Iconic Item

Pick a reaonable item that your character may have. You always have it for you, you value it. Also, it gives +2 bonus if you use it for a skill check. A few examples:

+ Notebook / diary
+ Bike / Skateboard
+ Lucky Bat
+ Dog
+ Walkie-talkie

## Pride

Pick what you're proud of, something that makes you feel strong, important, and valuable. It drives your decisions, can make you risk your live, put into troubles, drive into adventure, something you believe and always follow. For example:

+ Nothing scares me.
+ I never lie.
+ I never leave someone in need.
+ Drawn to anything different or strange.
+ I stood up for my friends.
+ Everybody likes me.
+ I'm the most curious person alive.
+ Drawn to anything different or strange
+ I need something to brag about.

In other words, give the DM something to get you in trouble and drive the adventure.

## Skill

Pick what you're good at. For example, fighting, running, fixing tech, recalling a knowledge, making and avoiding traps. All your checks for doing it gain +1 bonus.

## Problem

Something goes not really well in your live. It can lead to another story or, again, drive you to go on adventures. Some examples:

+ My father is a communist.
+ My brother is doing weird things in his room.
+ I get bullied at school.
+ My parents say that I’m good for nothing.
+ My family is short of money.
+ My aunt lives in our basement and she is crazy.
+ My brother refuses to go out of his room since the accident.
+ My teacher hates me.
+ I cannot read very well, and they want to move me. to a special class.
+ Someone is poisoning our animals.
+ I seriously hurt someone by mistake.
+ The tough guys hit me.

Pick one or make your own.

+ Absent-Minded
+ Blunt
+ Boastful
+ Clumsy

+ Vindictive

Provide a short description how it affects your character.

## Fear

What you're afraid of, what scares you. You'll want to avoid your fears, and when faced with them, you’ll behave more irrationally. Also, when dealing with your fear, you roll 1d12 instead of 2d6. Kids can be afraid something simple or irrational, like snakes, caves, thunder, dogs, darkness.

## Final notes

+ In any step, except generating attributes, you can ignore the recommended list and make your own. Ask the DM for approval if it affects the mechanic.
+ If you like writing things and telling stories, feel free to tell more about your character.
+ You're character is not finished yet, this is only the first half. The second part is to make relations between characters and NPCs, stay tuned.
