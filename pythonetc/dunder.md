How do you read `__init__`? "underscore underscore init underscore underscore"? Just "init"? There is a convention to read it "dunder init". it was [proposed by Mark Jackson](https://lists.gt.net/python/python/124634#124634) in 2002 and [popularized by Ned Batchelder](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200605/dunder.html) in 2006.
