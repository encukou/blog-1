Welcome into the season 2! In the next episodes:

1. New cool features in Python 3.9 (the final release is planned on 2020-10-05).
2. Python history and features that were removed.
3. PEPs in the "draft" status that aren't accepted nor rejected yet.
4. Short and useful code snippets to empower your code.
5. A lot more features and tricks, like in good old season 1.

Also, @orsinium joins the @pythonetc team. That means more posts and more points of view.

Show must go on!
