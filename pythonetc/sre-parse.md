Internally, the module [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) uses 2 undocumented libraries:

+ `sre_parse` to parse regular expressions into an abstract syntax tree.
+ `sre_compile` to compile parsed expression.

The first one can be used to see how a regexp was parsed by Python. There are many better tools and services (like [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/)) to debug regular expressions but this one is already in the stdlib.

```python
>>> sre_parse.parse(r'([Pp]ython)\s?etc').dump()
