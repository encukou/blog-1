# Cliche Talk

Hy everyone. First, I say hello, trying to set a positive attitude to my performance from the first words. Then I'm going to pause a little to get attention.

Then I'm going to introduce myself. I'm Gram. And now I draw your attention to the topic of the presentation. Oh yes, it will be your sister's favorite speach. About some technology, of course, as we love. I'll tell you a few meaningless words about it to convince you that you're not wasting your time. Even if it is not. And this is certainly not. I have nothing to tell you. I haven't prepared for this speech. But I will pretend that I have been preparing this speech all my life.

Ethos, pathos, logos. Three modes of persuasion, described by Aristotle.

Ethos. I'm going to say a few words about myself and my company. Of course, we use this technology, I introduced it for my team, and all sources of this technology in my blood. Actually, I just decided a week ago to get it into my pet project and hadn't had time to realize what a real Open Source where TODOs is for 5 years. After that I'm going to talk a little about the technology itself so that you have no doubt that I really have opened the readme. So I can be trusted.

To be even more convincing, I will add a slide with someone famous. A person standing next to Guido can't say rubbish.

Pathos. I will show you a few photos from photo stocks with inspirational text.
Friday Deploy can be a joy.
Your code is like a river.
Through my manner of speaking, through intonation, I will create the appearance that I say very important, amazing things. I'm going to do this with my right hand, I'm going to do this with my left. I'm going to adjust my glasses. And then I'm going to ask you all a question. By a show of hands, how many of you all have been asked a question before? Okay, great, I'm seeing some hands. I pretend to react to this, that my presentation really depended on it. I'm act like I'm telling you the story when everything was burning. Well, you know, these situations when prod fall at Friday night. It will set you up. You think, "Oh, we have so much in common!". It's true. It really happened.

Logos. I will tell you how cool this technology is. It is fast, configurable, convenient and all that. But this is not enough to be convincing.
I'll show you the numbers. Everyone believes the numbers. Not enough? I have graphics.
Do you have some favorite technologies? See, this one includes all features from them.
See, there are lines. It is easy to see that the blue one is better.
Our favorite. Pie chart. Please note: purple is more.

Of course, I'm going to show you some code. It is simple and clear code, and you will fall in love with it. Naturally, you will not be able to write it on the production.

And now I come back to where I started. This is the part of my presentation that you will remember at first. I summarize, and do it on the basis of the previous slides. Ethos, pathos, logos. It is very important to make a pause, it increase the weight of the words. And remember: the best conclusions are those that you have made by myself.
