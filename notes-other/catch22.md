# Catch-22

Catch-22 is a paradoxical situation from which one cannot escape because of contradictory rules. In particular, when you cannot have something without already having it.

I started to program and make websites back in school. In university, I "hired" my friends and founded my first startup. I had plenty of orders without any marketing. Thanks to all connections I made there, people just knew that I was "the guy who can make a cheap website." At the moment of my first interview for a permanent position, I already had 5 years of commercial experience, and people there had already heard about me. I was hired on the spot. And because of my impressive background and multiple projects, all my following positions were senior ones with a good salary.

My wife only after university realized what she really wanted to do for a living. She has tried a few different things (architecture, arts, animal care), finally settling on automated testing. Now, she's a self-taught and well-skilled QA engineer. She learned JS, Cypress, Postman, and Playwright from books, videos, and little projects and got a few certificates.

But now it's a bit too late. She followed me into another country, leaving all her friends behind; hence she doesn't have connections here. She doesn't have her own company or years of projects to show. All she has is skills, passion, and a few projects to show.

All her applications are rejected right away. After 40 applications, there is not a single interview. All positions she finds require years of experience and often some crazy skills. An internship that requires you to have a software engineering degree and 1+ year of experience? A frontend engineer internship that requires you to already know Java (sic!) and Swift? How's it even an internship?

And here you have it, Catch-22. You can't get experience without already having experience. How did we end up there? The IT industry prides itself on being informal, on not looking for years, connections, certificates, and degrees, on focusing on the real skills, and giving everyone a chance. And yet when the time comes to prove it, it all turns out to be not true. If you weren't in the right place at the right time, you are caught in Catch-22.
