# A brief history of Python typing

<https://www.python.org/community/sigs/retired/types-sig/>

The first appearance of Python type annotations as they are now happened back in 2004 in blog post by Guido van Rossum "[Adding Optional Static Typing to Python](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=85551)":

> Optional static typing has long been requested as a Python feature. It's been studied in depth before (e.g. on the type-sig) but has proven too hard for even a PEP to appear. In this post I'm putting together my latest thoughts on some issues, without necessarily hoping to solve all problems.

The most amazing thing in this blog post is how close this first take on the issue to what we have at the end. It has exactly same syntax for annotations as we have now.
