# ðŸ“° Gram Publishing v2

The next generation of my blog. The younger and prettier sibling of [articles.orsinium.dev](https://articles.orsinium.dev/p/). All good articles are moved here.

The main motivation for the transition is to reduce the maintenance work. The old version was powered by [chameleon](https://github.com/life4/chameleon) and lived on my server. The new version is powered by [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and lives on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Read all posts in a pretty interface: [blog.orsinium.dev](https://blog.orsinium.dev/).
